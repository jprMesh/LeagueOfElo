# League of Elo

Elo rating system and game predictions for Professional League of Legends Teams

## Fundamentals

Elo is a rating system developed to rate chess players, but it's a good system for rating players or teams in any zero-sum game. League of Legends is a zero sum game, so it should work for League as well.

The implementation of this model is based on [FiveThirtyEight's NFL team elo rating system model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/). There are two key points to note here:
1. For each match, the model generates a prediction and the teams gain/lose points based on how correct the model was. Because predicting match outcomes is integral to the model, it tunes itself over time to predict matches as optimally as possible.
2. Teams all start out at a 1500 rating. In between seasons, teams ratings regress 25% toward the mean (1500) to adjust for any roster or other changes. It also tells the model that there is more uncertainty at the beginning of each new season.

## Calibration

Brier scores were added to the model to calibrate for the optimal K parameter. This optimal value turned out to be about 30, which is a pretty high K parameter. This makes sense because we want to bias more heavily toward more recent results, and each team only gets 2 data points each week (during the regular season).

## LCS Predictions

The model currently has data going back to the beginning of franchising for the LCS. The plot below, generated by the model, shows the progression of team ratings since the start of franchising. The table below the figure shows the ratings of the LCS teams before the Spring 2019 finals.

LCS Elo Ratings
     TL  1674
    TSM  1651
     C9  1604
    FOX  1486
    FLY  1480
    GGS  1449
    OPT  1447
    CLG  1431
    100  1389
     CG  1385

### Predictions

Finally, the model can generate predictions for any hypothetical matchup. Of course the most interesting one is the finals matchup of TL vs TSM. The model is giving TL a very slight edge, giving them a 53% chance of taking down TSM in the finals.
